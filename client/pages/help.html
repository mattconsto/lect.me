		<h4>Creating</h4>
		<p>Creating a new show is easy, simple navigate to Home and enter a desired name. If you are not redirected to an editor, this means the room already exists and you will have to try again. Simply navigate back using your web browser.</p>
		<p>Authoring content in the editor can be done in three ways. After clicking "Create a new slide" on the left of the editor, you are given the choice of uploading, linking, or entering text. Uploading takes a file and converts it into a format your browser can understand. Linking embeds the external document into the show. Entering text allows you to type Markdown and MathML which is rendered nicely. You can also add white/blackboards.</p>
		<p>Using drag-and-drop you can reorder the slides, and by clicking on the Ã— you can delete them.</p>
		<p>To gauge engagement, simply look to the left of the editor, and you can see the number of connections.</p>
		<p>To navigate click on a slide or use the arrow keys.</p>
		<h4>Viewing</h4>
		<p>Viewing is easy, scan a QR code or enter a room name and that is it.</p>
		<h4>Quizzes</h4>
		<p>In interest of time, and to save reinventing the wheel, here are a number of recommended quiz websites:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.poll-maker.com/" target="_blank">Pollmaker is fantastic for real-time polls</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.quiz-maker.com/" target="_blank">Quizmaker creates easy to use quizzes</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you have any suggestions to be added, don't hesitate to ask.</p>
		<h4>Web-pages</h4>
		<p>Some web pages may fail to load and display a blank screen; this is because of the X-Frame-Option header which is preventing the browser from loading the sites. This is designed to stop clickjacking. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to get around this. For some sites such as YouTube, URLs are automatically rewritten to the embed page, allowing them to work.</p>
