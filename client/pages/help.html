		<h4>Creating</h4>
		<p>Creating a new show is easy, simple navigate to <a href="/">Home</a> and enter a desired name. If you are not redirected to an editor, that means the room already exists and you'll have to try again. Simply navigate back using your web browser.</p>
		<p>Authoring content in the editor can be done in three ways. After clicking "Create a new slide" on the left of the editor, you are given the choice of uploading, linking, or entering text. Uploading takes a file and converts it into a format your browser can understand. Linking embeds the external document into the show. Entering text allows you to type markdown and mathml which is rendered nicely. You can also add white/blackboards.</p>
		<p>Using drag-and-drop you can reorder the slides, and by clicking on the x you can delete them.</p>
		<p>To gauge engagement, simply look to the left of the editor, and you can see the number of connections.</p>
		<p>To navigate click on a slide or use the arrow keys.</p>
		<h4>Viewing</h4>
		<p>Viewing is easy, scan a QR code or enter a room name and that's it.</p>
